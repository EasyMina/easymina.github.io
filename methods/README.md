# Methods
`easy mina` is a Node.js module that assists newcomers in getting started with zk-snark development by providing a minimal and straightforward environment with minimal opinionated pre-configuration.

The goal is to offer developers a smooth entry into zk-snark development by creating a minimal workspace that focuses their attention on the structure. The simple setup indirectly explains fundamental rules. Additionally, best practices are built-in by default, such as key encryption and the inclusion of a `.gitignore` file with exclusions for the credential folder and its associated keys.


## Overview
The actual methods come with several configurable settings. To reduce complexity, the methods can be executed with as few parameters as possible or none at all.

The following methods are available:

| | **Method** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| A | [setEnvironment()](./setEnvironment.html) | Assists in creating your workspace | 
| B | [deployContract()](./deployContract.html) | Helps you upload your first Smart Contract | 
| C | [fetchInformation()](./fetchInformation.html) | Helps you easily query initial data from the GraphQL interface |  
| D | readContract() | coming soon... |
| E | updateContract() | coming soon... |
