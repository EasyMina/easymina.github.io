    | change the world with zk tech |  
    ---------------------------------  
```

`EasyMina` is a beginner-friendly Node.js module that assists you in creating a bare-bones environment for the Mina blockchain.

The goal is to offer developers a smooth entry into zk-snark development by creating a minimal workspace that focuses their attention on the structure. The simple setup indirectly explains fundamental rules. Additionally, best practices are built-in by default, such as key encryption and the inclusion of a `.gitignore` file with exclusions for the credential folder and its associated keys.

Happy building!
